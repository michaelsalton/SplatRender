## Known Issues & Blockers

### Current Issues
- None yet (project just started)

### Potential Risks
- CUDA development requires Linux machine ✅ RESOLVED (Now on Linux with RTX 2070)
- Performance targets may need adjustment
- PLY format variations need testing

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- Using GLM for mathematics (header-only, well-tested)
- Tile-based rendering with 16x16 pixels
- Front-to-back sorting for correct alpha blending
- Separate CPU implementation for validation

### Lessons Learned
- VS Code IntelliSense needs explicit configuration for GLM
- Homebrew paths differ on Apple Silicon Macs
- CMake find_package doesn't always work for all libraries
- CUDA 12.0 requires explicit `<memory>` include for std::unique_ptr
- cudaGLSetGLDevice is deprecated in CUDA 12.0 (but still works)
- GLEW.h must be included before any OpenGL headers to avoid conflicts
