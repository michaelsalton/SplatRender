## Known Issues & Blockers

### Current Issues
- None yet (project just started)

### Potential Risks
- CUDA development requires Linux machine
- Performance targets may need adjustment
- PLY format variations need testing

---

## Notes & Decisions

### Design Decisions
- Using GLM for mathematics (header-only, well-tested)
- Tile-based rendering with 16x16 pixels
- Front-to-back sorting for correct alpha blending
- Separate CPU implementation for validation

### Lessons Learned
- VS Code IntelliSense needs explicit configuration for GLM
- Homebrew paths differ on Apple Silicon Macs
- CMake find_package doesn't always work for all libraries
